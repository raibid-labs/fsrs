// Recursive list functions (Simplified)
// This example demonstrates what recursive list functions would look like
// Note: Requires recursion and pattern matching support

// For now, we demonstrate list construction patterns
// that would be used in recursive functions

// Building a list incrementally with cons
let step1 = [] in
let step2 = 5 :: step1 in
let step3 = 4 :: step2 in
let step4 = 3 :: step3 in
let step5 = 2 :: step4 in
let step6 = 1 :: step5 in

// Equivalent to reverse building [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]
// Each step prepends an element
let result = step6 in

// Demonstrate nested list construction
let matrix_step1 = [5; 6] :: [] in
let matrix_step2 = [3; 4] :: matrix_step1 in
let matrix_final = [1; 2] :: matrix_step2 in

// Return the final matrix
// Expected output: [[1; 2]; [3; 4]; [5; 6]]
matrix_final
