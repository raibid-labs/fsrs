// Basic array operations demonstration
// This example shows array literals, indexing, and basic usage

let empty = [||] in
let single = [|42|] in
let numbers = [|1; 2; 3; 4; 5|] in
let first = numbers.[0] in
let third = numbers.[2] in
let last = numbers.[4] in

// Return tuple showing all results
(empty, single, numbers, first, third, last)
// Expected: ([||], [|42|], [|1; 2; 3; 4; 5|], 1, 3, 5)
