# Issue 13: [Docs] Readme Brand Voice Overhaul

**Labels:** `documentation`, `branding`

## Context
The current README is functional but dry. It needs to sell the vision of "Fusabi" using our new brand voice: punchy, confident, and slightly playful (like Wasabi).

## Implementation Plan
**Objective:** Rewrite `README.md`.

1.  **Headline:**
    * Change "F# Script Runtime System" to "**Fusabi**".
    * Add Subtitle: "Small. Potent. Functional."

2.  **Value Proposition:**
    * Focus on *why*: "Rust is hard. Configuration shouldn't be. Fusabi adds a typed, functional scripting layer to your Rust apps without the bloat of a full VM."

3.  **Features List (Spicy Edition):**
    * *Typed:* "Don't guess. Know."
    * *Embedded:* "Fits inside your binary."
    * *Fast:* "Lua-class performance."

4.  **Visuals:**
    * Embed the new `assets/logo.svg` (from Issue 12) at the top.
    * Use the new color palette for code badges (e.g., build passing badge in Green).
