echo "1. ast.rs - Add List and Cons variants (IN PROGRESS - needs restoration)"
echo "2. lexer.rs - Add list tokens"
echo "3. parser.rs - Parse list syntax"
echo "4. value.rs - Add list value representation"
echo "5. instruction.rs - Add list instructions"
echo "6. compiler.rs - Compile list expressions"
echo "7. vm.rs - Execute list instructions"
echo "8. tests/list_tests.rs - CREATED"
